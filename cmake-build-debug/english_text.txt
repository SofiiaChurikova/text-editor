I usually teach English at a language school in the summer. I often can’t enjoy the summer because I am so busy.So this summer, I’m not planning to work. Instead, I’m going to have a proper summer holiday.
I’m going to buy a campervan and drive around Ireland.2 I’m going to visit lots of beautiful beaches and learn to surf! I’m mostly going to travel alone, but I will visit friends.
One friend, Cathy, is a school teacher, so she has a long summer holiday, so hopefully, we will spend a week or two together.
 Another Irish friend, Joe, has a new house there, so I’ll stay with him for a few days and help him paint the rooms.Last year, I did a surfing instructor course, and I spent the summer teaching people to surf. It was great!
